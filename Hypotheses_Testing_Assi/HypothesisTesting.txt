1.Business Problem
 1.1 Objective-->The objective of this project is to analyze various business 
 datasets and determine whether significant differences exist in the observed 
 data using statistical hypothesis testing. The goal is to provide data-driven 
 insights that aid in decision-making.

 1.2 Constraints-->Data should be normally distributed for parametric tests.
 -Assumptions of statistical tests must be validated before application.
 -Confidence level set at 95% (significance level ).
 -Availability and quality of data may impact results.
 
2.Data Pre-processing
  2.1 Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and EDA:
  -Load Data: Read the datasets into Pandas (Python) or data frames (R).
  -Handle Missing Values: Check for null values and impute or remove them.
  -Data Normalization/Transformation: Scale data if needed for certain algorithms.
  -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
     >Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).
     >Visualization (histograms, box plots, scatter plots).
     >Correlation analysis.
     
3.Model Building
  3.1 Partition the Dataset:Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) for model building.

  3.2 Model(s) - Reasons to Choose Any Algorithm:
   -T-Test: Used for comparing means of two groups (e.g., Cutlets diameter analysis).
   -ANOVA: Used for comparing means across multiple groups (e.g., Lab Turnaround Time analysis).
   -Chi-Square Test: Used for categorical data (e.g., Buyer Ratio and Customer Order Form analysis).
   -Non-Parametric Tests: Used when data is not normally distributed.

  3.3 Model(s) Improvement Steps:
   -Check assumptions (normality, homogeneity of variance, independence).
   -Use non-parametric alternatives if assumptions are violated.
   -Increase sample size for better statistical power.

  3.4 Model Evaluation:
   - P-Value Interpretation: If , reject the null hypothesis.
   - Effect Size Measurement: Understand practical significance.
   - Visualization: Use graphs to illustrate findings.
   
4.Deployment
 4.1 Deploy Solutions Using R Shiny and Python Flask:
   - Flask: Develop a web application to accept CSV uploads, run statistical tests, and display results.
   
5.Result
  5.1.Business Impact and Benefits
    - Optimized Quality Control: Helps in monitoring defects in manufacturing.
    - Improved Marketing Strategies: Identifies buyer behavior across regions.
    - Better Operational Efficiency: Analyzes customer service turnaround times.
    - Data-Driven Decision Making: Enhances business intelligence and strategic planning.
